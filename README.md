# README
## This is the README for my first vscode theme "Bearpip"

&nbsp;  

Please enjoy my (hopefully) lovely theme, or at least I hope you do. I will be editing it whenever I find something I don't like, when my tastes change, or when I find a problem.  

&nbsp;  

I made this mainly because my screen quality is so bad and a lot of the themes I have found so far I'll either like the text colours but the background didn't match, or there was one colour (usually pink) that I disliked. In the end I just decided maybe it would be easier to create my own.  

&nbsp;  

I did a lot of research in how best to go about this. I found helpful pages [here](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/ "Creating a VS Code Theme") and [here](https://medium.com/wearelaika/vscode-create-your-own-custom-theme-extension-96c67bd753f6 "VSCode: Create your own custom theme extension") and I took a lot of inspiration from the lovely colours in tinkertrain's Panda theme [here](https://github.com/tinkertrain/panda-syntax-vscode "Github link to Panda theme"), the github code helped me to understand what the various names, and I found more help and colours in wesbos' cobalt2 theme [here](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode "Github link to cobalt2 theme"). The demo files I borrowed from sdras' nightowl theme git [here](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme "Github link to nightowl theme"), these colours were lovely too.  

&nbsp;  

I hope this is ok. I can't imagine anyone will even find this theme anyway, but just if someone does, please let me know what you think and if I need to make changes. I personally already have a list of things that need to be done.

**Thank you for reading, I hope you like it!**
