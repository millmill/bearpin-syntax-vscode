# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Bearpip" extension will be documented in this file.


## "0.1.0"
- Initial release

## "0.1.1"
- Switched to black/grey/charcoal background for every menu element with very dark grey (black) editor
- After testing with poor quality display, the blue/navy/grey menu/title was reset with editor itself becoming slightly less dark - charcoal

## "0.1.2"
- Switched the line numbers area in editor back to the blue and added a border for when the editor is split.

## "0.1.3"
- Found that the title bar gets confused on my poor quality screen, some text colours needed to be changed for visiblity. Lightened comments and made words legible after being highlighted.
